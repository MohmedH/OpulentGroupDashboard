                    Investors should be aware that hedge funds often engage in leverage, short-selling, arbitrage, hedging, 
                    derivatives, and other speculative investment practices that may increase investment loss. 
                    Hedge funds can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, 
                    and often charge high fees that can erode performance. Additionally, they may involve complex tax structures and delays 
                    in distributing tax information. While hedge funds may appear similar to mutual funds, they are not necessarily 
                    subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds.
